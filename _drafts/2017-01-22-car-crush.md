title:  "Crushed by the weight of the snow"
description: We learned a lesson about careful parking in the lot at Truckee Labs. A huge amount of snow has accumulated in the trees over the past few days and last night a big chunk fell down onto Monica's car, crushing the roof and smashing the windshield. Fortunately nobody was hurt!
